# MLPC-GROUP-ASSIGNMENT-

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize energy distribution in a simulated power grid with 10 nodes, 3 energy sources, and a 24-hour demand cycle. It includes both serial and parallel implementations, where the parallel version uses Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing to speed up fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation by utilizing multiple CPU cores. The GA minimizes energy distribution cost while considering transmission losses and fluctuating hourly demand. The outcome includes optimized energy allocation for each hour, total cost reduction, and execution time comparison between serial and parallel approaches, showing that the parallel GA significantly reduces computation time while maintaining or slightly improving optimization performance.
